# PDF Text Extractor

This repository contains a lightweight web page that reads text aloud using your browser's native speech synthesis.

## Usage

1. Open `docs/index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Upload a PDF to extract its text or paste text directly into the textarea.
3. Click **Extract PDF Text** to load the PDF and **Listen** to hear it spoken.
4. Use **Pause**, **Resume** and **Stop** to control playback.

You can also use the command-line script `pdf_text_extractor.py` to convert a PDF to an MP3 audiobook.
